    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <li>First, set out a large mixing bowl and add in the ground beef, crushed crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce, milk, and spices.</li>
        <li>Use your hands to thoroughly combine until the mixture is very smooth.</li>
            <li>Next, press the meat down in the bowl, into an even disk. 
                Use a knife to cut and divide the hamburger patty mixture into 6 - 1/3 pound grill or skillet patties, or 12 thin griddle patties.</li>
                <li>Set out a baking sheet, lined with wax paper or foil, to hold the patties. One at a time, gather the patty mix and press firmly into patties of your desired thickness.</li>
                    <li>Place the formed patties on the baking sheet. With thick patties, press a dent in the center of each patty, so they don't puff up while cooking.</li>
                        <li>You can stack the patties with sheets of wax paper between layers if needed.</li>
                            <li>Then, preheat the grill or a skillet to medium heat, approximately 350-400 degrees F.</li>

    <h1>Pizza</h1>
    <img src="https://www.southernliving.com/thmb/9fFmtjTp_-pf3nIQKGl60FscgKk=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/sl_supremepizza_00072-2000-4cab71bd67774233b45f05e4e32fdfde.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It's a true supreme pizza: bacon, pepperoni slices, red and green bell pepper, red onion, black olives, mozzarella, Parmesan, and basil.
       Our Test Kitchen calls it an "old-school supreme pizza [like] one would get at Pizza Hut, Shaky's, or a classic pizzeria." 
       The olives and peppers are classic additions that give the pizza a strong nostalgia factor. 
       It's so easy to make at home, and you probably have a few of the ingredients already on hand. 
       A Test Kitchen tip: When it comes to jarred pizza sauce, Rao's is the way to go, no question. 
       Another tip from the Test Kitchen: 
       "Using a very high oven temperature is a pro tip to getting that pizzeria-style crispiness, rise, and texture from your store-bought dough.
       A pizza stone ensures a crisp bottom crust. If you don't have one, use a baking sheet turned upside down." 
       Voila! There's dinner, and if you have any leftovers, a deliciously cold breakfast slice just might be in your future.</p>
